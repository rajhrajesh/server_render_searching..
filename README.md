# React JS Server Fetching

This is a simple React application that fetches and displays stories from the [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search). Users can search for stories based on a search term, view the results, and remove stories from the list.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for stories based on a given keyword.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while fetching data.
- **Error Handling**: Shows an error message if the data fetch fails.
- **Story Removal**: Allows users to remove stories from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Remembers the search term even after refreshing the page.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the components.
- **Local Storage**: To persist search term between sessions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajhrajesh/server_render_searching...git
